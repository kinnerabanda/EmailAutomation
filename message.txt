Dear ${PERSON_NAME}

My name is Kinnera Banda and I am a resident of Grand Rapids, MI. Given the history of policing and 
the most recent murders of Black people, I am asking you to redirect money away from the Police 
Department in the 2021 budget and instead to prioritize services that help strengthen our communities.

I want a budget that reflects our community's priorities and needs. We want the Police Department's 
funding redistributed to services that actually help the people, including affordable
housing, more mental health services, and rent suspension and forgiveness for those who are currently
unemployed. Beyond policing our community, these services are proven to be more effective in
improving community safety and wellness. I demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather 
than giving power to police forces that tear us apart.

Please consider your role in enriching and empowering our communities, especially amidst systemic 
racial injustice, wide-spread illness, and economic vulnerability.

Thank you, 
Kinnera Banda
